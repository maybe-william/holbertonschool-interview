# This folder and file is the question:

If you have n locked boxes in front of you and each box is numbered from 0 to n-1 (represented by a list of boxes, with each box represented as a list, and each index representing the number of the box), write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened if only box #0 is open to start.
